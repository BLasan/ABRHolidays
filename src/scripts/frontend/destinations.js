        description: "Adam's peak is a holistic destination, which draws people from four main faiths to worship the foot print placed on the summit, and to behold the glorious sunrise which is iconic. Locally known as 'Sripada'; which is translated to 'Sacred foot' in English, each of the faiths believe it's due to a connection to their religion. Buddhists accept as true, that it is the foot print of Lord Buddha who has placed it during his 3rd visit to Sri Lanka. Hindus believe it is the print of God Shiva, and Muslims believe it to be the mark of Adam when he was expelled from Garden of Eden. Christians too share the same belief with Muslims but also give various views on the print by stating it is St. Thomas's. Apart from various explanations and beliefs, the truly miraculous feat about Adam's peak is that all four religions harmoniously ascend this breathtaking summit, achieving a greater miracle than the rest.",

        description: "Majestically located in the North Central Province, the city of Anuradhapura was first settled by Anuradha, a follower of Prince Vijaya the founder of the Sinhalese race. Throughout the timeline which goes back to nearly 1000 years, Sinhalese kings and occasional South Indian intruders reigned from the palaces of Anuradhapura. It was the most extensive and significant of the Sri Lankan royal capitals, but its extent of its history since its collapse, make it more difficult to understand than younger, shorter-lived Polonnaruwa. Many ancient monuments still stand tall, and have become a fascinating place for site seeing. Ruwanwelisaya stands on the top of the must see list when in Anuradhapura as it's one of the tallest stupas in the country, and dates back to 2BC. At present the city is a rather delightful, inspiring memento of a glorious past, worthy of being named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site out of the eight named from Sri Lanka.",
